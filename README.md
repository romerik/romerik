# üëã Hi, I'm Romerik Lokossou

## About Me
I'm an AI and Robotics Engineer with a Master's degree from Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in Engineering Artificial Intelligence. My expertise centers on building intelligent embodied systems that can learn from minimal human demonstration and adapt to real-world environments.

## ü§ñ Technical Interests
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Deep RL, model-free and model-based approaches (SAC, PPO), Quantum RL
- **Robotics**: Quadruped robots, humanoid robotics, motion control, sim-to-real transfer
- **Machine Learning**: Computer vision, generative AI, LLMs, multimodal models
- **Programming**: Python, C++, ROS, Linux
- **Simulation**: MuJoCo, Isaac Gym, PyBullet, Gazebo
- **Cloud & Backend**: AWS, GCP, Azure, Django REST Framework, FastAPI, Flask

## üî¨ Current Work
- Developing advanced motion control systems for quadruped robots
- Researching multimodal human-robot interaction through voice and gesture
- Implementing reinforcement learning algorithms for complex robotic tasks
- Building RAG systems and enterprise-grade AI solutions

## ü§ù Collaboration Interests
- Robotics projects involving legged robots or humanoids
- Reinforcement learning research and applications
- Multimodal AI systems for embodied agents
- Innovative AI solutions with real-world impact
